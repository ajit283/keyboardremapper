# Keyboard remapper

this is a proof of concept for implementing qmk-style tap-hold functionality for mac. Currently, only the **spacebar** can act as the tap-modifier and the arrow keys IJKL work, though this can be changed at the top of main.m. I just bodged this together in order to use my HHKB similarly to how I use QMK Keyboards, so if someone who actually knows Objective-C would like to improve this program, your help would be greatly appreciated..
